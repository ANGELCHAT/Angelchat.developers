Be sure that you have the node >= 6.0.0 and npm installed. Next, clone this repository and run:

```

To build your static output to the `/dist` folder, use:

```bash
rm -rf ./dist
npm run build
```

## Structure

## Basic Concepts

You can read more about Hugo's template language in their documentation here:

https://gohugo.io/templates/overview/

The most useful page there is the one about the available functions:

https://gohugo.io/templates/functions/

1. For assets that are completely static and don't need to go through the asset pipeline,
use the `site/static` folder. Font-files, PDFs, etc, all go there.

2. Files in the static folder ends up in the web root. So a file called `site/static/favicon.ico`
will end up being available as `/favicon.ico` and so on...

3. The `src/js/app.js` file is the entrypoint for webpack and will be built to `/dist/app.js`.

4. You can use ES6 and use both relative imports or import libraries from npm.

5. Any CSS file directly under the `src/css/` folder will get compiled with Sass
to `/dist/css/{filename}.css`. Import statements will be resolved as part of the build
